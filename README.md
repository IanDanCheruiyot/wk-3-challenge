# wk-3-challenge

This is my weekly code challenge

#### {Brief description of application}, {Date of current version}

This is an application called Flatdango that I built for FLatiron Movie Theatre to allow the users manage to buy to buy tickets online cutting the time spent queueing at the cinema. The user can now purchase his ticket online and on arrival at the cinema go ahead and buy the snacks of his choosing and head on in.
